## Firebase Backend Setup

This application uses Firebase for authentication and as a database. To run it, you must first set up your own Firebase project.

### Step 1: Create a Firebase Project
1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  Click **"Add project"** and give it a name (e.g., "NutriLife AI").
3.  Follow the on-screen steps. You can disable Google Analytics if you wish.

### Step 2: Register Your Web App
1.  In your project's dashboard, click the **Web icon (`</>`)**.
2.  Give your app a nickname and click **"Register app"**.
3.  Firebase will show a `firebaseConfig` object. **Keep these values handy**, as you'll need them later.

### Step 3: Enable Authentication Methods
1.  In the left menu, go to **Build > Authentication**.
2.  Click **"Get started"**.
3.  Under the **"Sign-in method"** tab, click **"Add new provider"**.
4.  Enable the providers you want:
    *   **Email/Password**: Select it, click the **Enable** switch, and save.
    *   **Google**: Select it, click the **Enable** switch, choose a project support email, and save.

### Step 4: Set Up Firestore Database
1.  In the left menu, go to **Build > Firestore Database**.
2.  Click **"Create database"**.
3.  Start in **production mode**.
4.  Choose a location for your database.

### Step 5: Configure Firestore Security Rules
1.  In Firestore, go to the **"Rules"** tab.
2.  Replace the default rules with the following to ensure users can only access their own data. This is a critical security step!
    ```
    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        // Users can only read and write to their own document.
        match /users/{userId} {
          allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
3.  Click **"Publish"**.

## Vercel Deployment Guide

Deploying this app to Vercel is the recommended way to get it online.

### Step 1: Import Your Project
1. Log in to your [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account.
2. From your dashboard, click **"Add New... > Project"**.
3. Import your project from your GitHub repository.

### Step 2: Configure Build & Output Settings
Vercel should automatically detect that this is a **Vite** project. If you need to check or enter them manually, use the following:

- **Framework Preset:** `Vite`
- **Build Command:** `npm run build`
- **Output Directory:** `dist`
- **Install Command:** `npm install`

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables
This is the most important step for connecting to Firebase and Google AI.
1. In your new Vercel project's dashboard, click on the **"Settings"** tab.
2. Choose **"Environment Variables"** from the menu on the left.
3. Add the **seven** required variables one by one. The `KEY` must match exactly. The `VALUE` comes from your Firebase project config and Google AI Studio.

| Key                                     | Value                                      |
| :-------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| `API_KEY`                               | `your-google-ai-api-key-goes-here`         |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`                 | `your-firebase-api-key`                    |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`             | `your-firebase-auth-domain`                |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`              | `your-firebase-project-id`                 |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`          | `your-firebase-storage-bucket`             |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`     | `your-firebase-messaging-sender-id`        |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`                  | `your-firebase-app-id`                     |

### Step 4: Deploy
1. After adding all environment variables, you must **trigger a new deployment**.
2. Go to the **"Deployments"** tab for your project.
3. Find the most recent deployment, click the "..." menu on the right, and select **"Redeploy"**.
